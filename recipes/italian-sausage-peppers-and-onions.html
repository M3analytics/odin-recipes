        <div class="five">
            <ul>
                <li>Italian Sausage: Sweet Italian sausage is perfect for this top-rated recipe. To turn up the heat a bit, try using half hot Italian sausage.</li>
                <li>Butter: Two tablespoons of butter is all you'll need to saut√© the veggies. Of course, you could substitute olive oil if you prefer.</li>
                <li>Onions: Slice one yellow onion and half of one red onion. If you prefer a milder flavor, just use one and a half yellow onions.</li>
                <li>Garlic: Mince four cloves of fresh garlic to add to the vegetable mixture for authentic Italian flavor.</li>
                <li>Bell Peppers: Slice one red pepper and one green bell pepper.</li>
                <li>Spices and Seasonings: This sausage and peppers recipe is simply seasoned with dried basil and dried oregano.</li>
                <li>Wine: Opt for a dry white wine such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. If you don't have any wine on hand, reviewers say they've had success substituting with chicken broth or beer.</li>

                Brown the sausage on all sides in a hot skillet. Transfer the sausage to a plate and slice. Cook the garlic and onions in melted butter for about three minutes, then add the peppers and dried herbs. Stir in the wine and cook until the veggies are tender. Return the sausage to the skillet and simmer, covered, until sausage is cooked through.

                This easy dinner recipe is full of satisfying meat and vegetables, so you don't technically need to serve it with anything (though it would be delicious served over pasta or white rice). You could also serve it on a hoagie with a slice of provolone. If you'd like to pair it with something extra, try one of these Italian-inspired side dishes:
